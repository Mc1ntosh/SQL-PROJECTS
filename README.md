# SQL-PROJECTS
Collection of SQL projects by Michael McIntosh 
**********************************************
Dog_Store was inspired by interest for Dog Grooming. On the weekends I volunteer 3 years at a local pet shop called Zen Animals. Throughout my time I developed dog grooming skills as well as receptionist skills. Doing reception gave permission to work in the costumers booking system. As a result, I recorded frequency/cacellations of certain costumers in the year 2022. With this information Zen Animals could view which costumers to follow up on or do research to determine why certain costumers cancel.

You can also view my achievement by searching for koinu.portfolio on instagram.
