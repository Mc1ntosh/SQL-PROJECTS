1.Dog_Store.sql

Dog_Store was inspired by my interest for Dog Grooming. On the weekends I volunteer 3 years at a local pet shop called Zen Animals. Throughout my time I developed dog grooming skills as well as receptionist skills. Doing reception gave permission to work in the costumers booking system. As a result, I recorded frequency/cancellations of certain costumers in the year 2022. With this information, Zen Animals could improve their costumer retention rate by viewing which costumers to follow up on or determine why certain costumers cancel appointments.

You can also view my achievements by searching for koinu.portfolio on instagram.
